Welcome to Frances "Reagan" James's GitHub profile!

---------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔥 What I'm Working On

- **Latest Build:** [Smart Nest Video Updater](https://github.com/FrancesReagan/smart-nest-video-updater) Chrome extension (v1.0.0) - Detects educational videos on YouTube, identifies outdated content, and provides real-time notifications. Built to solve the "outdated tutorial" problem when software versions changes.

- **Current Focus:** Integrating OpenAI API to auto-generate "What's Changed" summaries for outdated educational videos.

- **Next Phase:** Expanding SmartNest into an AI-powered EdTech platform with features like auto-updating explainer videos, customizable AI teachers, and gamified learning experiences.

- **SmartNest Learning Tracker:** Full-stack learning management system featuring secure authentication, advanced UI/UX, and seamless MERN stack integration. [Live App](https://smartnesttracker.netlify.app).

- **Looking to collaborate on:** AI integration for education, including natural language processing, generative AI content, and personalized learning experiences

------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a certified Software Engineer and proud graduate of the Per Scholas Software Engineering bootcamp. Over 15 weeks, I built 53 repositories while mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and modern web development practices. My strength: learning fast and building solutions to real problems in education.

**Starting January 2026:** commencing my Masters Program: MSc in Data Science/Machine Learning. I'll be combining software engineering with machine learning to build intelligent EdTech products—think recommendation systems for learning paths, predictive models for student success, and AI-powered features that adapt to how people actually learn. I will continue to deepen my learning on building both the models AND the applications that use them.
