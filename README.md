## 👋 **About Me**

Software Engineer and Per Scholas bootcamp graduate with a B.S. in Biology. I built 53 repositories over 15 weeks, mastering the MERN stack and modern web development practices. My work demonstrates rapid learning, consistent delivery, and a passion for educational technology innovation.

📍 Atlanta, GA  
🎓 B.S. in Biology | Starting Master's in Data Science, January 2026  
💡 Focused on AI/ML applications in education

**Starting January 2026:** Beginning my Master's in Data Science/Machine Learning. I'll be combining software engineering with machine learning to build intelligent EdTech products - recommendation systems for learning paths, predictive models for learner success, and AI-powered features that adapt to how people actually learn. My goal is to master both building the models AND the applications that use them.
